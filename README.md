# Family Movie Night

## Introduction
The intended design behind this project was to create an application for families or friends planning a movie night to put up movie suggestions. 
They can write a review of the movie which in this case would serve as a justification for why that movie should be the pick!

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js, Bootstrap
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **APIs**: Movie database OMDB
- **Deployment**: Render

## Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.
1. git clone https://github.com/LukeZem/MOD3_Project.git
2. npm install
3. In a .env file enter your API as such: API_KEY = 'ENTER YOUR API'

## Unsolved Problems
Currently the images provided by the API are only rendering in the dev environment

## Future Enhancements
1. Ability to login/signup
2. Create user groups that only the users of those groups can access the reviews
3. Ability to upvote or downvote a movie choice by users within the group
